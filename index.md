  Hi there, I'm Calvin. I'm a software engineer and musician, and I try to be a nice person. In my career I consider myself a "full stack engineer", for whatever that's worth. These days that's a lot of TypeScript. For now, I'm most excited about Music Mini Games (see below)</p>

<span class="app-description"> <p>*Stopped playing audio, removed from production (until I have time to repair)* </p>This one is really just an experiment, but I think
it's kind of neat. It generates music / sound and over controls over the physics
and tonality.</span>
