Hi there, I'm Calvin. I'm a software engineer and musician, and I try to be a nice guy. Right now I'm an engineer at Spotify.
I like ownership of products that people like to use. I suppose my strongest technical skills are somewhere around TypeScript / JavaScript,
but I like all kinds of engineering. If you want to get in touch, the best way
to do that would be email to calvin.flegal at gmail. Here are a few little side projects I've done in my free time, of varying states of completeness / maintenance / brokenness:

## Paper Audio

<span class="app-description">Paper Audio is a place for musicians to share
short mp3 demos and potentially have their demos featured via Alexa and Google
Home.</span>

## Note Tuning

<span class="app-description">A challenging ear training game that will
hopefully become part of a larger suite of music tools.</span>

## Note Collider

<div style="display: flex" class="app-link">
<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/note-collider.jpg" />
<span class="app-description"> <p>*Stopped playing audio, removed from production (until I have time to repair)* </p>This one is really just an experiment, but I think
it's kind of neat. It generates music / sound and over controls over the physics
and tonality.</span>
</div>

## Tune Up

<span class="app-description">My very first foray into iOS Apps, a dead simple
ear training game.</span>
