Hi there, I'm Calvin. I'm a software engineer and musician, and I try to be a nice guy. Lately I'm mostly a JavaScripter, but more broadly I like ownership of products that people like to use. If you want to get in touch, the best ways are email to calvin.flegal at gmail,
or through [twitter](https://twitter.com/calflegal). I'd also be thrilled if you 
subscribed to my mailing list at the bottom of this page. I don't expect to be bothering you too
often. Here are a few little projects I've done in my free time:

Note Tuning

<a href="https://www.notetuning.com" class="app-link" style="display: flex;" >
![Note Tuning]({{site.url}}/assets/images/note-tuning.png "Note Tuning")
<span class="app-description">A challenging ear training game that will
hopefully become part of a larger suite of music tools.</span>
</a>
<hr />

Note Collider

![Note Collider]({{site.url}}/assets/images/note-collider.jpg "Note Tuning")
<span class="app-description">This one is really just an experiment, but I think
it's kind of neat. It generates music / sound and over controls over the physics
and tonality.</span>

Tune Up

![Tune Up]({{site.url}}/assets/images/tune-up.jpg "Note Tuning")
<span class="app-description">My very first foray into iOS Apps, a dead simple
ear training game.</span>
